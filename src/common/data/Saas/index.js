      "If you use software to dropship on eBay, it will need to connect to eBay to make changes to your store. For example, if you want to put a product up for sale, then Salefreaks has to pass that information to eBay to create a product listing.here are two main methods for doing this, either using eBay’s API, or without using eBay’s API.API Dropshipping – This is when you use software that connects to eBay’s API to pass information to eBay.The main benefit of API dropshipping is that you can use it to dropship with any eBay account. The downside is that when you connect to eBay’s API, they will apply a “flag” to your account to note that you’re a dropshipper. Once this happens, your listings will be displayed lower in the search results and you will get far less sales than other eBay sellers.Non-API dropshipping – This either means dropshipping without software, or using software to dropship on eBay that doesn’t connect to eBay via their API, but by using other technical means instead. The main benefit of Non-API dropshipping is that eBay won’t detect that you’re dropshipping, and therefore won’t flag your account. This means you can receive 5-10x more sales than most other dropshippers. However, you can only do Non-API dropshipping if your eBay account has never been used for API dropshipping in the past.",
